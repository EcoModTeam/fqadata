`fqadata` contains regional Floristic Quality Assessment  databases that have been approved or approved with reservations by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Paired with the [fqacalc](https://github.com/ifoxfoot/fqacalc) package, these datasets allow for Floristic Quality Assessment metrics to be calculated. Both packages were developed for the USACE by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center's Environmental Laboratory.

You can also install the development version of fqadata from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```
